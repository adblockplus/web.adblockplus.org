<h2 id="general">{{s5 What is Adblock Plus?}}</h2>

<p>
  {{s6 Adblock Plus is the most popular browser extension available for Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera and Android. Its primary purpose is to remove all intrusive advertisements from your browsing experience: YouTube video ads, Facebook ads, banners, pop-ups, pop-unders, background ads etc.}}
</p>

<h2 id="workings">{{s7 How does Adblock Plus work?}}</h2>

<p>
  {{s8 In order to block ads, Adblock Plus requires the so-called filters to "tell" it which requests to block. Out of the box, Adblock Plus comes without any filters, but, it will offer you to add a filter subscription on first start. With these filters enabled, it can block specific requests from websites, usually the requests to serve an ad. Blocked ads often leave blank spaces or "Advertising Tags" on webpages. Adblock Plus is still able to remove these with a functionality called "element-hiding": based on certain specific characteristics, Adblock Plus is able to hide certain elements from the webpage.}}

<h3>{{s26 On Android}}</h3>

<p>
  {{s27 Adblock Plus is also available for Android devices. It is important to note, that there are <a href="android-about#general">a few  limitations</a> for non-rooted devices.  To install Adblock Plus, you will need to allow app installation from unknown sources:}}
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    {{s28 Open "Settings" and go to "Unknown sources" option (under "Applications" or "Security" depending on your device)}}
  </li>
  <li>
    {{s29 Tap the checkbox and confirm the upcoming message with "OK"}}

  {{s30 In order to download Adblock Plus for Android, access the <a href="android-install">Android installation page</a>, download the app and open it.}}
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2 id="firststeps">{{s32 First steps}}</h2>

<h3 id="subscription">{{s33 Choosing the right filterlist}}</h3>

<p>
  {{s34 As previously described, Adblock Plus requires filterlists to block ads. By itself, Adblock Plus can only see the webpage you are loading, but has to be "told" by the filterlist which elements to block. When you install Adblock Plus for the first time, it will automatically suggest a filterlist to you based on the language settings of your browser.}}
</p>

<p>
  {{s35 There are a two basic lists out there, EasyList and Fanboy's List. These two lists block the ads from the most popular (often English) websites. However, these lists do not block ads on less popular national websites. In the case that you, for example, come from Germany, you will have to subscribe to the national German filter list. In this case, this will be "EasyList Germany + EasyList". An overview of all the lists can be found <a href="subscriptions">here</a>.}}
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    {{s36 It is important to note that you should not add too many filterlists to Adblock Plus. This will slow down the adblocker, therefore, your browsing. As a rule of thumb, it is highly recommended to not use overlapping filterlists (e.g. choose either EasyList OR Fanboy's List).}}

</p>

<p>
  {{s37 You can also use filterlists to protect yourself against tracking, malware, social media tracking etc. Read more about this <a href="features">here</a>.}}
