<p>
  {{s2 The user interface of Adblock Plus is intentionally not very customizable, the idea is to
  have it work well out of the box without requiring users to tweak things.}} {{s3 As a
  result, some compromises have to be made and sometimes the user interface is suboptimal for
  power users.}} {{s4 Customizations extension is a collection of semi-supported user
  interface tweaks for people who feel the need to change something.}}
