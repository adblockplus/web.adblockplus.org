<h3 id="abp_notifications">{{s57 Emergency notification}}</h3>

<p>
  {{s58 Recent Adblock Plus versions contain an emergency notification mechanism that allows them to

<p>
  {{s68 Adblock Plus stores some data in
  <a href="{{s68-link http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Profiles}}">the Firefox profile</a>

  extensions and services, such as
  <a href="https://services.mozilla.com/privacy-policy/">Firefox Sync</a>,
  may do so.}} {{s70 Most of the data (your preferences, filter subscriptions and custom
  filters) is unobjectionable privacy-wise.}} {{s71 However, filter hit statistics and recent
  issue reports could be used to reconstruct your browsing history.}} {{s72 Adblock Plus treats
  this information identically to how history data is treated by the browser:}} {{s73 this data
  isn't stored if you are using
  <a href="{{s73-link http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Private+Browsing}}">Private Browsing mode</a>
