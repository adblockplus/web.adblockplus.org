</p>

<ul>

<p>
  {{s32 Your browser periodically checks for updates of all your extensions including Adblock

  system and your IP address, are transmitted during an update check.}} {{s34 Adblock Plus nightly

<p>
  {{s39 If you add filter subscriptions to your Adblock Plus installation, the subscription
  will be requested to regularly retrieve updates.}} {{s40 Every update results in the hosting
  website receiving your IP address as well as some general information like your Adblock Plus
  version, browser and browser version.}} {{s41 This data is subject to the privacy policy of the
  website in question.}}
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h3 id="abp_issue_reporter">{{s45 Issue reporter}}</h3>

<p>

  required to investigate the issue including the Adblock Plus version, browser version,
  address of the web page where the problem is visible, blockable items on the web page,
  matching filters and active subscriptions.}} {{s48 Parameter values are removed from all
  transmitted addresses to avoid unintentionally leaking private information.}} {{s49 It is also
  possible to provide additional information, which may be privacy-sensitive:}}
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    {{s50 A website screenshot provides a scaled-down and color-reduced version of the page
    viewed.}} {{s51 It is possible to remove particularly sensitive sections of the page before

</ul>

<p>

  {{s55 These addresses are only shared with the maintainers of the filter subscriptions mentioned in
  the report and are unlikely to be found by others unless a link is provided.}} {{s56 All
  reports and their associated data are automatically removed after 30 days.}}
</p>

<h3 id="abp_notifications">{{s57 Emergency notification}}</h3>

<p>
  {{s58 Recent Adblock Plus versions contain an emergency notification mechanism that allows them to
  notify users about important issues affecting their Adblock Plus installation.}} {{s59 This
  feature requires all Adblock Plus installations to query an address in the AdblockPlus.org
  domain regularly to retrieve the list of active notifications.}} {{s60 This request makes
  your IP address visible to the website and also sends some general information like your Adblock
  Plus version, browser and browser version.}} {{s61 This data allows serving different
  notifications to different clients and is subject to the usual
  <a href="#logs">AdblockPlus.org privacy policy</a>.}}
</p>

<h3 id="abp_website_requests">{{s62 Further requests}}</h3>

<p>
  {{s63 Adblock Plus may make further requests to the AdblockPlus.org website as required. For

  <a href="#logs">AdblockPlus.org privacy policy</a>.}}
</p>

<h3 id="abp_data">{{s65 Data retention}}</h3>

<p>
  {{s68 Adblock Plus stores some data in
  <a href="{{s68-link http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Profiles}}">the Firefox profile</a>
  on your computer.}} {{s69 Adblock Plus never transmits this data to any servers, but other
  extensions and services, such as
  <a href="https://services.mozilla.com/privacy-policy/">Firefox Sync</a>,
  may do so.}} {{s70 Most of the data (your preferences, filter subscriptions and custom
  filters) is unobjectionable privacy-wise.}} {{s71 However, filter hit statistics and recent
  issue reports could be used to reconstruct your browsing history.}} {{s72 Adblock Plus treats
  this information identically to how history data is treated by the browser:}} {{s73 this data
  isn't stored if you are using
  <a href="{{s73-link http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Private+Browsing}}">Private Browsing mode</a>
  and is removed if you choose to clear your browsing history.}}

<h2 id="emailcollection">{{s81 Email collection}}</h2>

<p>
  {{s82 Some of our webpages host product campaigns that rely on email collection.}} {{s83 For example, you can request a link by email to install Adblock Browser on your mobile
  device.}} {{s84 We do not use third parties to manage these campaigns. Instead, data that you submit is handled in-house (i.e. turned into an email or used to send the email).}}
  {{s85 Further, we do not store your email address unless it’s specifically required to execute the related campaign (i.e. email signups for a newsletter or signing up to get notified about a product launch).}}
  {{s86 In cases where we do store your email address, we only store it for the length of time that is needed to execute the campaign (i.e. once you’ve been notified of the launch).}}
  {{s87 We will never share or sell your email address, or any other information collected, to any third parties.}}
