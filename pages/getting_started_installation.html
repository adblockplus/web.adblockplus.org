title=Getting started with Adblock Plus - Installing Adblock Plus


        <h2 id="thunderbird">{{s1 Installation in Thunderbird and Prism}}</h2>

        <p>{{s2 In Thunderbird and Prism you cannot navigate to addons.mozilla.org directly. To install Adblock Plus nevertheless, go to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/1865">addons.mozilla.org</a> in your browser, right-click the big green installation button and choose &quot;Save Link As&quot; from the context menu. Choose a location to download Adblock Plus to. Then switch to Thunderbird or Prism and go to the menu Tools / Add-ons. Click the &quot;Install&quot; button at the bottom of the dialog and select the Adblock Plus package you downloaded previously. Restart the application when asked.}}</p>

        <h2 id="kmeleon">{{s3 Installation in K-Meleon}}</h2>

        <p>{{s4 K-Meleon doesn't have an extension installation mechanism. Because of that Adblock Plus for K-Meleon is a ZIP file that needs to be extracted into K-Meleon's application directory. See <a href="kmeleon">Adblock Plus for K-Meleon</a> page for installation packages and detailed installation instructions.}}</p>

        <h2 id="incompatible">{{s5 Dealing with "not compatible" error message}}</h2>

        <p>{{s6 If you cannot install Adblock Plus because it is "not compatible", this might mean two things:}}</p>

        <ul>
               <li>{{s7 Your application is too old and a newer version has been out for some time already. Adblock Plus cannot support old application versions for an indefinite amount of time, already because after a while too few people use that application version and bugs no longer get noticed. Best solution is updating to a new application version and installing Adblock Plus then. If for some reason that is not possible, as a temporary solution you can also have a look at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addons/versions/1865">older Adblock Plus versions</a>, one of them might be compatible.}}</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
               <li>{{s8 Your application is too new and Adblock Plus hasn't been marked compatible with it yet. If you didn't do that already, try installing from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/1865">addons.mozilla.org</a> and make sure that JavaScript is enabled — installation from addons.mozilla.org will provide the browser with more current compatibility information. If that doesn't help either, please create a new topic in the <a href="/forum/">forum</a> (no registration required).}}</li>
        </ul>
