<h2 id="project">{{s3 What is Adblock Plus?}}</h2>

<p>
  {{s4 Adblock Plus is a free extension that allows you to - among <a href="features">other things</a> - block annoying ads, disable tracking and block domains known to spread malware. Available for Android, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Maxthon, Opera, Safari and Yandex, Adblock Plus uses filters that you 
  choose to block all unwanted elements.}}
  </p>

<p>
  {{created Created by Wladimir Palant in 2006, Adblock Plus is an open source project. In 2011, Palant, together with Till Faida, founded <a href="https://eyeo.com">Eyeo</a> to make its development sustainable.}}
  </p>

<h2 id="workings">{{s5 How does Adblock Plus work?}}</h2>

<p>
  {{s6 Adblock Plus itself has no functionality; it doesn't block anything until you "tell" it what to block by adding external filter lists. Filter lists are essentially an extensive set of rules that tell Adblock Plus which elements of a website to block.
  You can add any filter list you want. For example, block <a href="features#tracking">tracking</a> or <a href="features#malware">malware</a>. You can also <a href="filters">create your own filter lists</a>.
  Almost all filters are open source, therefore many filter lists have been created by Internet users.}}
</p>

<p>
  {{s7 Filter lists enabled by default include:}}
  <ul>
    <li>{{s8 An ad-blocking list selected based on your language (EasyList)}}</li>
    <li>{{s9 The Acceptable Ads list}}</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  {{s10 These are enabled to get you started. You can remove them or add others - it's up to you.}}
</p>

<p>
  {{EasyListdefined EasyList corresponds to your browser language and is aimed at disabling ads that are considered to be intrusive by our community of users. Eyeo GmbH <strong>did not</strong> draft EasyList and therefore has no right to, or control over, its content. Visit the <a href="https://easylist.adblockplus.org/">EasyList Community</a> for more information.}}
</p>

 <p>
  {{AcceptableAdsdefined The Acceptable Ads list displays ads that comply with the acceptable ads criteria agreed upon by our community of users. The list is maintained by Eyeo GmbH.}}

<h2 id="acceptableads">{{s11 What are Acceptable Ads?}}</h2>

<p>
  {{s12 We don't think all ads are bad and are fully aware that ads finance many websites. So, in 2009 we decided to find some common ground. Our solution involved asking Adblock Plus users,
  and our community at large, to help identify criteria that makes for better ads. From these discussions, we established <a href="acceptable-ads#criteria">strict criteria</a> to identify nonintrusive ads. In 2011, we began implementing the Acceptable Ads initiative.
  Participants that wish to comply with the Acceptable Ads initiative can <a href="acceptable-ads#application">apply</a> to be added to the Acceptable Ads list. 
  Adblock Plus users have the option to display ads that are on the Acceptable Ads list or to disable the Acceptable Ads feature and browse completely <a href="acceptable-ads#optout">ad-free</a>. To view the list of acceptable ads, visit the <a href="https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=12">Acceptable Ads Proposals forum</a>.}}
</p>

<p>
  {{s13 Please see the <a href="acceptable-ads">Acceptable Ads FAQ</a> to learn more.}}
</p>

<h2 id="monetization">{{s14 How is Adblock Plus financed?}}</h2>

<p>
  {{s15 We receive donations from our users and are being paid for support services performed for some larger entities that want to participate in the Acceptable Ads initiative.}}

    {{s17 Managing the Acceptable Ads initiative requires significant effort on our side including, but not limited to, ongoing review and monitoring of the individual whitelisted ads, counselling participants and technical support.
	This service cannot be completely taken over by volunteers nor be sponsored through donations, as it happens with common filter lists.}}
  </p>
  <p>
    {{s18 Therefore, a few very large entities who take part in the Acceptable Ads initiative compensate Eyeo for its service. Eyeo's service is provided free of charge to all other participants (roughly 90%).}}
  </p>
  <p>
    {{s19 <strong>Important:</strong> Every entity on the whitelist - paying participant or non-paying participant - MUST maintain the same strict criteria that our users accepted as part of the Acceptable Ads initiative. We will never accept any ad that doesn't meet these <a href="acceptable-ads#criteria">criteria</a>. 
	There is no way to buy a spot on the Acceptable Ads exception list. All whitelisted ads and participating entities are publicly listed in <a href="https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=12">our forum</a>. Feel free to discuss and share your opinions.}}

<h2 id="whymoney">{{s20 Why do we need money?}}</h2>

<p>
  {{s21 <a href="https://eyeo.com">Eyeo GmbH</a>, the company behind Adblock Plus, was founded to pursue a different vision of online advertising. This is not something a single person can do as a hobby.}}

   <p>
    {{s24 Our goals are simple:}}
	<ul>
	  <li>{{work Continue to work on Adblock Plus so that it can function on various platforms}}</li>
	  <li>{{improve Keep improving the functionalities of Adblock Plus to provide users with the best possible tool to protect them from malware and have better control of their browsing experience and collection of their personal data}}</li>

    {{eyeoneeds In regards to the Acceptable Ads initiative, Eyeo needs to review and analyze many applications. This includes reviewing ad format, safety precautions, compliance with the Acceptable Ads criteria and technical feasibility of the requested whitelisting, creating the filters for the whitelist, testing the filters, posting to the forum, etc.}}

  <p>
