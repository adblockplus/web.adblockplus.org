The Services allow you to—among other things—customize your web experience. With the Services, you can block annoying ads, disable tracking, block domains known to spread malware, and lots more. Additional information on the Services can be found [here](index).

    1. **Premium Services.**  Premium subscriptions of the Services are also available for purchase. In addition to having the same features that are available under the free versions of the Services, the subscriptions of the Services also have additional premium features.

    1. **Adblock Plus for Safari iOS (version 3.x or higher).**

        1. **License Grant.** Subject to and conditioned on your compliance with the terms and conditions of these Terms, we grant to you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, and non-assignable license to download, install, and use a copy of Adblock Plus for Safari iOS App (version 3.x or higher) for your personal, non-commercial use on a compatible device that you own or control solely as expressly authorized and/or required by these Terms.

        1. **Ownership.** You acknowledge and agree that a copy of Adblock Plus for Safari iOS (version 3.x or higher) is provided under license, and not sold, to you. You do not acquire any title or ownership interest in or to Adblock Plus for Safari iOS (version 3.x or higher), including any copy thereof, or any rights other than your right to use your copy of Adblock Plus for Safari iOS (version 3.x or higher) in accordance with the license granted to you in these Terms. Except as expressly granted to you in these Terms, we and our licensors reserve our entire right, title, and interest in and to Adblock Plus for Safari iOS (version 3.x or higher), including all copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights arising therefrom or related thereto. Further, we reserve all rights not expressly granted or waived in these Terms.

    1. **Feedback.**  You may, but are not required to, provide us with recommendations, suggestions, comments, ideas, proposals, evaluations, reviews, feedback, input or other information related to the Services (collectively **“Feedback”**). In the event that you provide us Feedback, you hereby grant us and our affiliates a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to use Feedback in any way for any purpose without reimbursement or compensation and without any obligation to report on such use or other restriction on such use.

1. **Non-Permitted Use of the Services.**  Please note that some website owners may not permit ad filtering users to visit their websites. You agree that you will not use the Services in the following cases:

    1. You may not use the Services on any website on which you have agreed not to use ad filtering tools (e.g., by agreeing to Terms of Services on respective websites to not use any ad filtering tools).

    1. You may not use the Services in connection with any tools that circumvent technological measures that effectively control access to websites or certain website content.

1. **What are Acceptable Ads?**  By default, nonintrusive ads are not blocked when using the Services in order to support websites ([learn more](acceptable-ads)). You can disable this feature at any time ([guidelines on how to disable Acceptable Ads](acceptable-ads#optout)). Disabling Acceptable Ads does not affect the other functionalities of the Services.

1. **What should you do if the Services are not working properly?**

    1. Except for any statutory rights for digital products and services to which you may be entitled and which cannot be waived as a matter of law, the Services are provided “as is” and on “as available” basis. You acknowledge and understand, for example, that the Services may not be available during a maintenance or repair window, a power outage, or an internet service interruption.

    1. You use the Services at your own risk. We do not make any representation or warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or function in an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free manner. Without limiting the generality of the previous statements, we also do not make any representation or warranty that all ads will be blocked. Please note that [Acceptable Ads](about#acceptableads) will be displayed via the Services as part of their default settings.

    1. You acknowledge and understand that the filters that are used on the Services may occasionally result in blocked content. This is an unwanted side effect of some filters and cannot be completely avoided.

    1. The Services by themselves do not have any functionality. They do not block anything until you “tell” them to block certain elements of a website by adding [external filter lists](https://adblockplus.org/en/about#workings) to the Services. Filter lists are essentially an extensive set of rules that instruct the Services which elements of a website to block. You acknowledge and understand that we do not have contrel over filter lists.

    1. We encourage you to immediately [report](bugs) any errors or incorrect blocking of the Services that you may discover. These reports will help us improve the Services.

1. **Liability for Damages.**

    1. Except with respect to claims for damages to you arising from injury to life, body, health, or from the violation of essential contractual obligations (so-called cardinal obligations), eyeo will only be liable for damages to the extent that damages are based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by eyeo, its legal representatives, or its vicarious agents. Essential contractual obligations are those whose fulfillment are necessary to achieve the objective of the contract.

    1. In the event of a breach of essential contractual obligations, eyeo is only liable for the foreseeable damage typical for the contract if such damage was caused by simple negligence, unless your claims for damages are based on injury to life, body, or health.

    1. The limitations of liability made in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 above also apply to the legal representatives, employees, and vicarious agents of eyeo if claims are asserted directly against them.

    1. The limitations of liability made in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 above do not apply if eyeo has assumed a guarantee for the quality of the Services or has fraudulently concealed a defect of the Services. The limitations of liability made in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 above also do not apply if eyeo and you have reached a separate, written agreement on the quality of the Services. The provisions of the German Product Liability Act remain unaffected.

1. **Premium Services Terms of Use.**

    1. **Application.**  The terms and conditions under this Section 7 only apply to your use of the subscriptions of the Services. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Section 7 and the other terms and conditions of these Terms, the terms and conditions of this Section 7 will govern but solely with respect to the subject matter of this Section.

    1. **Right of Withdrawal of Contract under German Law.**

        1. Under German law, you are entitled to a statutory right of withdrawal from a contract when entering into contracts for certain consumer transactions. Subject to Section 7.2.2 below, this right can be exercised at any time within 14 days from entering into the contract for the transaction (the “**Withdrawal Period**”). For clarity, your statutory Withdrawal Period commences on the date that you receive an e-mail confirmation of your purchase of the subscription of the Services.

        1. Your statutory right of withdrawal from a contract under German law expires for contracts for the supply of digital content that is not based on a tangible medium upon the occurrence of the following events:

            1. the vendor (e.g., us) has begun to perform the contract;

            1. the consumer (e.g., you) has expressly agreed that the vendor may begin to perform the contract before the end of the withdrawal period;

            1. on commencement of performance of the contract, if the consumer has confirmed that he is aware that his right of withdrawal from a contract will expire as a result of his consent in accordance with Section 7.2.2.2 above; and 

            1. the vendor has provided the consumer with a confirmation in accordance with Section 312(f) of the German Civil Code.

    1. **Multiple Installations.**  During the period of time that your subscription of the Services is active, you may install and re-install the subscription on all your supported devices without incurring any additional costs. 

    1. **Premium Services Term and Termination.**

        1. These Terms will become effective with respect to your use of the subscription of the Services on the date that you receive an e-mail confirmation of your purchase of the subscription and will continue in effect until your subscription is no longer active.

        1. At the end of each subscription period, your subscription of the Services will automatically renew for additional subscription periods that are each equal in duration to the subscription period that had just lapsed. For example:

            1. For 1-year subscription periods, your subscription of the Services will automatically renew for additional 1-year subscription periods.

            1. For 1-month subscription periods, your subscription of the Services will automatically renew for additional 1-month subscription periods.

        1. You will be charged the then-current price for subscriptions of the Services that is valid at the time of your renewal.

        1. You may terminate your subscription of the Services at any time during your subscription period.

        1. Each of our (i.e., you and eyeo) right to extraordinary termination of these Terms for good cause remains unaffected. An important reason exists in particular if one party intentionally or negligently violates an essential obligation from this contract and therefore the terminating party can no longer be reasonably expected to adhere to the contract.

1. **Dispute resolution.**  The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (OS). This can be accessed via the following link: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr. eyeo GmbH is neither obliged nor willing to participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board.

1. **Final provisions**

    1. The law of the Federal Republic of Germany will govern these Terms to the exclusion of the provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  If, however, your habitual residence at the time that you downloaded or purchased the Services (as applicable) is located in a jurisdiction which requires the application of its own laws to these Terms, then such laws will govern these Terms.

    1. At the time that these Terms become effective on each of us (i.e., you and eyeo), there are no verbal ancillary agreements and/or additions. Collateral agreements, amendments, or supplements must be made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party to be effective. The waiver of the written form requirement must also be in writing.

    1. In the event that a circumstance beyond our reasonable control prevents us from providing you the Services in accordance with these Terms (each a “**Force Majeure Event**”), you acknowledge and agree that we have no obligation under these Terms to the extent and duration of such Force Majeure Event. 

    1. In the event that any provision of these Terms is or becomes invalid, such invalidity will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.
