## {{abp-subheading[sub-heading] <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> }}

{{introductory-paragraph[paragraph] We, <fix>eyeo GmbH</fix>, <fix>Lichtstrasse 25, 50825 Cologne, Gemany</fix> ("<fix>eyeo</fix>"; "we"), have developed the browser extension <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> ("<fix>ABP</fix>") which can be downloaded via at our [website](https://adblockplus.org) and other domains. <fix>ABP</fix> is a free extension that allows you to – among [other things](https://adblockplus.org/en/features) – customize your web experience. You can block annoying ads, disable tracking, block domains known to spread malware and lots more. It's available for all major browsers, including <fix>Chrome</fix>, <fix>Firefox</fix>, <fix>Internet Explorer</fix>, <fix>Maxthon</fix>, <fix>Opera</fix>, <fix>Safari</fix> and <fix>Yandex.Browser</fix>. <fix>ABP</fix> uses filters that you choose to block unwanted elements. }}

### {{meaning-heading[heading] What does that mean? }}

{{meaning-paragraph[paragraph] <fix>ABP</fix> is provided free of charge to you as a user. However, we've reached a point where further Terms of Use, such as these, are necessary. This protects you and it protects us. These Terms of Use apply to your use of <fix>ABP</fix>. }}

### {{free-meaning-heading[heading] What do you mean "<fix>ABP</fix> is free to use?" }}

{{free-meaning-paragraph[paragraph] <fix>ABP</fix> is an open source project, licensed under [<fix>GPLv3</fix>](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/), and can be used by anyone free of charge. The use of <fix>ABP</fix> is subject to the restrictions of the [<fix>GPLv3</fix>](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/). }}

### {{not-permitted-heading[heading] Non-permitted use of <fix>ABP</fix> }}

{{not-permitted-paragraph[paragraph] Please note that some website owners may not permit ad-blocking users to view their website. That must be respected, especially in the following cases: }}

- {{not-permitted-item-1[list item] You must not use <fix>ABP</fix> on websites where you have agreed not to use it, i.e. by agreeing to Terms of Services on the respective website, not to use any ad blockers. }}
- {{not-permitted-item-2[list item] You are not permitted to use <fix>ABP</fix> in connection with any tools to circumvent technological measures that effectively control access to websites. }}

### {{acceptable-ads-heading[heading] What are <fix>Acceptable Ads</fix>? }}

{{acceptable-ads-paragraph-1[paragraph] By default, nonintrusive ads aren't blocked when using <fix>ABP</fix> in order to support websites ([learn more](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads)). You can disable this feature at any time by opting out ([guideline how to disable <fix>Acceptable Ads</fix>](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#optout)). This does not affect <fix>ABP</fix>'s functionalities. }}

{{acceptable-ads-paragraph-2[paragraph] Within our <fix>Acceptable Ads</fix> program the following rules have and always will apply to everyone, without exception: }}

- {{acceptable-ads-item-1[list item] Participants cannot pay to avoid the [criteria](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#criteria-general). Every enabled ad must comply. }}
- {{acceptable-ads-item-2[list item] For transparency, we add all <fix>Acceptable Ads</fix> to our [forum](https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=12) so that our community of users can provide feedback. }}
- {{acceptable-ads-item-3[list item] We listen to our users. If an <fix>Acceptable Ads</fix> proposal is flagged by our community for a legitimate reason, we will remove it from the whitelist. }}

{{acceptable-ads-paragraph-3[paragraph] We are able to keep our open source product free by charging large entities a fee for whitelisting services. For the other roughly 90 percent of our partners, these services are offered free of charge. }}

### {{abp-error-heading[heading] What if <fix>ABP</fix> does not work properly? }}

{{abp-error-paragraph-1[paragraph] <fix>ABP</fix> is provided "as is" and on an "as available" basis. Your use of <fix>ABP</fix> is at your own risk. <fix>eyeo</fix> makes no warranty or condition that <fix>ABP</fix> will meet your requirements or be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free: }}

- {{abp-error-item-1[list item] <fix>eyeo</fix> makes no warranty or condition that all ads will be blocked; in particular [<fix>Acceptable Ads</fix>](https://adblockplus.org/en/about#acceptableads) will be shown in <fix>ABP</fix>'s default setting. }}
- {{abp-error-item-2[list item] **You acknowledge and understand that the filters used may occasionally lead to blocked content. This is an unwanted side effect of some filters and cannot be completely avoided.** }}
- {{abp-error-item-3[list item] <fix>ABP</fix> itself has no functionality; it does not block anything until you "tell" it what to block by adding [external filter lists](https://adblockplus.org/en/about#workings). Filter lists are essentially an extensive set of rules that tell <fix>ABP</fix> which elements of a website to block. <fix>eyeo</fix> has no influence on those filter lists. }}

{{abp-error-paragraph-2[paragraph] In the case that you detect any defect or incorrect blocking, including the blocking of content, [inform](https://adblockplus.org/en/bugs) us as soon as possible. }}

### {{additional-information-heading[heading] Additional information }}

{{additional-information-paragraph-1[paragraph] This Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. If you have no place of jurisdiction in Germany or in any other EU member state, if you have transferred your permanent domicile abroad after these Terms of Use take effect or if your domicile or usual place of residence is unknown at the time legal action is taken, the sole place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this agreement will be the location of our registered offices. }}

{{additional-information-paragraph-2[paragraph] We reserve the right to amend and adapt these Terms of Use with effect for the future. You can request the currently applicable version of the Terms of Use from our [legal department](mailto: legal@eyeo.com) or access them on our website. You will be notified no later than one month before new Terms of Use take effect. If you do not object to the validity of the new Terms of Use within one month after they take effect, you will be deemed to have accepted the new Terms of Use. We will inform you separately in suitable form about the significance of the one month's notice period, your right to object and the legal consequences of non-objection. This amendment mechanism does not apply to amendments to the parties' main contractual obligations. }}
