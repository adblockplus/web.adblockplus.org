    {{ an_overview Here's an overview of the work we've recently introduced in Adblock Plus. }}
  </h2>
  <p>
    {{ improved_ad_blocking_functionality <strong>Improved ad blocking functionality</strong>. Many websites look for ways to prevent Adblock Plus from blocking annoying ads. As a result, we've focused on improving our functionality so that we can overcome these anti-ad blocking attempts. }}
  </p>
  <p>
    {{ whats-new-list-3 <strong>Improved foundation for the future</strong>. Manifest V3, the latest version of the extension platform for Chromium based browsers, is on the horizon. And we’ve been getting ready for it! MV3 represents a large shift in how browser extensions will work, requiring our team to make some big changes to how Adblock Plus works. We’ve made lots of progress so that we can continue to help Adblock Plus users stay in control of their online experience as the web evolves. }}
  </p>
  <p>
    {{ hide-cookie-notices <strong>Hide cookie consent notices.</strong> Soon you’ll be able to put an end to those annoying cookie consent banners used on most websites thanks to a new cookie blocking feature we’re finishing up. }}
  </p>
  <p>
    {{ block_more_popups_and_distractions <strong>Block more pop-ups and distractions.</strong> Say goodbye to survey requests, newsletter pop-ups, and annoying autoplay video ads when you unlock Adblock Plus Premium. }}
