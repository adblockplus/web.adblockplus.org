      {{ whats-new-list-3 <strong>Better Performance.</strong> We’ve improved our logic when checking for turned off filter lists so that Adblock Plus uses less bandwidth. }}

      {{ whats-new-list-5 <strong>Better Debugging.</strong> For our technical users we introduced a debug mode for element-hiding filters that can be turned on in the Adblock Plus Advanced settings page. You can easily highlight elements that are affected by element-hiding filters. }}
