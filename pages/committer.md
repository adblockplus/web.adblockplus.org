title=Becoming a committer


{{intro Anyone can [contribute code](contribute) to any of our projects. But if you're contributing to a project on a regular basis, it makes sense to request commit access.}}

{{ask-module-owner To become a committer for a project, ask the [module owner](modules) responsible for it. Make sure to include the following:}}

1. {{past-contributions A list of your past contributions - the module owner will decide whether to grant you access based on those.}}
2. {{ssh-key Your public SSH key.}}

{{mandatory-reviews Note that whether you're a committer or not, every change needs to be reviewed by the respective module owner.}}

{{inactive-comitters Also note that we will revoke commit access for anyone who has been inactive for a while. Just ask again if that happens to you.}}
