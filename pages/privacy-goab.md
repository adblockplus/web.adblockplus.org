#### Legal basis of data collection and processing

We collect and process your personal data in compliance with the GDPR and the applicable EU laws and German national data protection laws.

#### Collection and processing is based on your consent - Art. 6 (1) a GDPR, Art. 4 (11) GDPR

We use information collected and processed via subscription downloads, extension update checks, emergency notifications and feedback data sent by you, for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, ensuring the security of the extension version used by you. Ensuring the security of our extension is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use such data.
