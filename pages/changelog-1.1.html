        <ul>
               <li>{{s3 Thunderbird: When clicking "Subscribe" in the subscription list on first run, the entire Thunderbird window is closed. This should be fixed in Thunderbird soon (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=503299">bug 503299</a>).}}</li>
               <li>{{s4 SeaMonkey: Toolbar icon looks ugly with the Modern theme. Modern theme doesn't seem to consider the possibility of extensions, using it with Adblock Plus isn't recommended.}}</li>
               <li>{{s5 Some translations contain untranslated English strings.}}</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="features">{{s6 New features}}</h2>

        <ul>
               <li>{{s7 Added handling of HTTP redirects, the redirect address now shows up in the list of blockable items as well as the original address, both can be blocked.}}</li>
               <li>{{s8 Added support for <a href="https://help.eyeo.com/adblockplus/how-to-write-filters#flexible-anchors">flexible anchors at start of filter</a> (<a href="/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3344">forum topic</a>).}}</li>
               <li>{{s9 Added support for ^ character that will match a <a href="https://help.eyeo.com/adblockplus/how-to-write-filters#separators">single separator character or end of address</a> (<a href="/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3344">forum topic</a>).}}</li>
               <li>{{s10 Added support for <a href="https://help.eyeo.com/adblockplus/how-to-write-filters#elemhide_domains">domain exceptions in element hiding</a> analogous to the $domain option of regular filters, e.g. "example.com,~foo.example.com##foo" or "~example.com##foo" (<a href="/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3919">forum topic</a>).}}</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
               <li>{{s12 "Block" button on plug-ins (e.g. Flash or Java) is no longer shown permanently, it only shows up when the mouse is on the plug-in area.}}</li>
               <li>{{s13 Added "Re-enable Adblock Plus on this page" context menu item for pages where Adblock Plus is disabled, this removes/disables the filter responsible.}}</li>
               <li>{{s14 Browser integration code runs in its own context now, this makes conflicts with other extensions less likely.}}</li>
               <li>{{s15 Changed the way "add subscription" links work, these can now only be triggered by user clicking a link.}}</li>
               <li>{{s16 Added diagnostic page displaying all errors related to Adblock Plus as well as Adblock Plus version/source code revision, can be opened by typing <code>chrome://adblockplus/content/errors.html</code> into the location bar.}}</li>
               <li>{{s17 Fixed: ABP icon updates its status every two seconds, hogs CPU time.}}</li>
               <li>{{s18 Fixed: Detection of background images breaks the context menu.}}</li>
               <li>{{s19 Fixed: "Disable on ..." doesn't work correctly if the exception rule already exists but is disabled.}}</li>
               <li>{{s20 Fixed: "Disable on ..." doesn't work correctly with rules that already exist in filter subscriptions rather than user-defined filters.}}</li>
               <li>{{s21 Fixed: Input focus issues when closing list of blockable items in current Firefox nightly builds.}}</li>
