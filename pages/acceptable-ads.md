## {{about[Section header] What is this about?}} {: #info }

{{about-abp[Paragraph in "about" section] Adblock Plus is a tool that lets users block ads. Since ads fuel a lot of the content we enjoy for free online, finding common ground seemed to make sense. We asked our users about this and they overwhelmingly agreed.}}

{{abp-history[Paragraph in "about" section] So starting in 2011, in consultation with [our users](/blog/adblock-plus-user-survey-results-part-0), we decided to propose a compromise. Because we share a vision with the majority of our users that not all ads are equally annoying, the Acceptable Ads initiative was created. It allows advertisers and publishers who have agreed to make ads that abide by user-generated criteria to be whitelisted. Users can support this less extreme version of ad blocking by allowing the Acceptable Ads option to remain enabled. To browse completely ad-free, users can [disable the option](#optout).}}

{{benefit[Text in "about" section] The Acceptable Ads initiative is beneficial because it encourages the ad industry to pursue less intrusive ad formats, thus having a positive impact on the Internet as a whole. It also provides us with a [viable source of revenue](/about#monetization), paid only by larger participants in the Acceptable Ads initiative, which we need in order to be able to administer and maintain the program and continue development of a free product.}}

{{our-belive[Paragraph in "about" section] We believe that this initiative is a sustainable middle ground between the user's choice to use ad blockers and the continued need to support free online content with advertisements. In general, an Acceptable Ad is a non-animated ad, clearly labeled as such, that does not interrupt reading flow. It is important to note that these criteria try to reflect the ongoing discussions between our users, publishers, advertisers and us. They will evolve as the web changes and as we receive more feedback. We explicitly invite everyone to join the dialog on [our forum](/forum/viewforum.php?f=17) or contact us at [acceptableads@adblockplus.org](mailto:acceptableads@adblockplus.org). Furthermore, in the very near future we intend to hand over complete control of these criteria to [an independent committee](/blog/campdavid-nyc).}}

{{fairness-rules[Text in "about" section] To ensure transparency and fairness, the following rules have and will always apply to everyone without exceptions:}}

* {{avoid-criteria[Fairness rule Bullet point in "about" section] Participants cannot pay to avoid the criteria. <strong>Every ad has to comply with the criteria.</strong>}}
* {{transparency[Fairness rule Bullet point in "about" section] For transparency reasons, we add all Acceptable Ads to our forum to provide our community with the opportunity to submit feedback. We greatly value feedback and read all comments.}}
* {{user-value[Fairness rule Bullet point in "about" section] Adblock Plus users are valuable to us and we listen to them. If, for valid reasons, any Acceptable Ads proposal is rejected by our community, the ad(s) will be removed from our whitelist.}}

{{charging[Paragraph in "about" section] We are able to keep our open source product free [by charging large entities a fee](/about#monetization) for whitelisting services. For the other roughly <fix>90</fix> percent of our partners, these services are offered free of charge.}}

{{default-reason[Text in "Why is this feature enabled by default?" section] Unfortunately, this is the only way to accomplish the goals described above. If the majority of Adblock Plus users have this function activated, advertisers will have the incentive to produce better ads.}}

## {{hate-ads[Section header] But I hate all ads!}} {: #optout }
{{can-disable[Text in "hate ads" secion] No problem, you can disable this feature at any time:}}

{{disable-chrome[Text in "hate ads" secion] <strong>Chrome, Maxthon, Opera, Safari</strong> - Click the Adblock Plus icon and select <strong>Options</strong>. Uncheck <strong>Allow some nonintrusive advertising</strong>.}}

{{agreement-ads[Text in "which acceptable ads are unblocked" section] No. Unfortunately, it isn't technically possible to recognize ads that meet our Acceptable Ads criteria automatically. We have <a href="/acceptable-ads-agreements">agreements</a> with some websites and advertisers which stipulate that only advertising matching our criteria will be displayed when Adblock Plus users visit these particular sites. These ads will be unblocked (i.e. added to the Acceptable Ads exception list which is enabled per default).}}
{{everyone-must-comply[Text in "which acceptable ads are unblocked" section] No applicant will be favored or treated differently, and no one can buy their way onto the whitelist. <strong>Everyone must comply</strong> with the criteria and everyone goes through the same process before the ads qualify as "acceptable".}}

## {{false-positives[Section header] What if an ad is allowed, but doesn't meet the requirements?}} {: #false-positives }
{{false-positives-report[Text in "doesn't meet requirement" secion] Please <a href="/getting_started#false-negatives">report it</a>. If an advertiser abuses its placement on the exception list, we can always remove it from the list.}}

{{acceptable-ads-filter[Text in "what you is allowed" section] The <strong>Allow nonintrusive advertising</strong> checkbox simply adds one more filter subscription to your list.

Also, the special treatment of this filter subscription - which was added for reasons of usability - can be disabled by going to "about:config" and changing the <a href="/preferences#subscriptions_exceptionscheckbox">extensions.adblockplus.subscriptions_exceptionscheckbox</a> preference to false.

{{survey[Text in "who want acceptable ads" section] The <a href="/blog/adblock-plus-user-survey-results-part-3">results of our user survey</a> say yes. According to the survey, only 25 percent of Adblock Plus users are strictly against all advertising. They can disable the feature and browse completely ad-free. The other 75 percent replied that they would accept some advertising to help support websites.}}

## {{revenue[Section header] Is there payment involved?}} {: #revenue }
{{main-revenue[Text in "Is there payment involved?" section] We receive some donations from our users, but our main source of revenue comes as part of the Acceptable Ads initiative. Larger entities (as defined below) pay a licensing fee for the whitelisting services requested and provided to them (around 90 percent of the licences are granted for free). It should be noted that the Acceptable Ads criteria must be met independent of the consideration for payments. If the criteria are not met, whitelisting is impossible.}}

{{who-pays[Text in "Is there payment involved?" section] Regarding fees, only large entities (those with more than 10 million additional ad impressions per month due to participation in the Acceptable Ads initiative) have to pay. For these entities, our licensing fee normally represents 30 percent of the additional revenue created by whitelisting its acceptable ads.}}
