## {{ about-heading[heading] What are Acceptable Ads? }} {: #info }

{{ acceptable-ads-about[paragraph] Acceptable Ads are ads that aren't intrusive or annoying. They are respectful, don't interfere with content, and are clearly labeled with the word "advertisement" or its equivalent. In order for an ad to be an "Acceptable Ad", it must adhere to [strict criteria](https://acceptableads.com/about/criteria) that has been set forth by the [Acceptable Ads Committee](https://blog.acceptableads.com/). }} 

{{ about-whitelist[paragraph] Ads that abide by the Acceptable Ads criteria are placed on a whitelist. The ads on the whitelist are then shown to ad-blocking users who allow Acceptable Ads. }}

## {{ why-default[heading] Why is the Acceptable Ads feature enabled by default? }} {: #default }

{{ default-reason[paragraph] We believe that Acceptable Ads are the sustainable middle ground between a user’s choice to use an ad blocker and the continued need to support free online content with advertisements. If the majority of Adblock Plus users have the Acceptable Ads feature enabled, advertisers will have a bigger incentive to produce better, less intrusive ad formats. }}

### {{ hate-ads[section header] But I hate all ads! }} {: #optout }

{{ can-disable[Text in "hate ads" secion] No problem, you can disable this feature at any time: }}

## {{ does-users-need[heading] Do Adblock Plus users really want Acceptable Ads? }} {: #who }

{{ survey[paragraph] Yes! [Eighty-three percent (83%)](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers#LINK1) of Adblock Plus users don’t mind seeing Acceptable Ads because their browsing experience isn’t ruined by loud, annoying and irrelevant ads. }}

## {{ all-unblocked[heading] Are all annoying ads blocked? }} {: #which }

{{ agreement-ads[paragraph] No. It isn't technically possible to automatically recognize ads that don’t meet the Acceptable Ads criteria. We have [agreements](/acceptable-ads-agreements) with some websites and advertisers which stipulate that only advertisements matching the Acceptable Ads criteria will be displayed when Adblock Plus users visit these particular sites. }}

{{ everyone-must-comply[paragraph] **Anyone who wants their ads on the Acceptable Ads whitelist must comply** with the Acceptable Ads criteria. There is no favoritism, no one can buy their way onto the whitelist, and all applicants go through the same process before their ads can qualify as "acceptable". }}

{{ acceptable-ads-filter[paragraph] Absolutely. You can view the list [here](https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/exceptionrules.txt). }}

- {{ false-positives-reproduction[list] If known, indicate whether a login or VPN is necessary to reproduce issue }}
