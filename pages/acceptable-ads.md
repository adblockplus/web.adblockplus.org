{{ default-reason[Text in "Why is this feature enabled by default?" section] We believe that Acceptable Ads are the sustainable middle ground between a user’s choice to use an ad blocker and the continued need to support free online content with advertisements. If the majority of Adblock Plus users have the Acceptable Ads feature enabled, advertisers will have a bigger incentive to produce better, less intrusive ad formats. }}
