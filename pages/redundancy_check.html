<p>{{s8 This page will evaluate a list of filters to find out which filters can be removed. It can detect cases like <code>http://example.com/ads/*</code> and <code>*/ads/*</code> where the first filter is made redundant by the second. In the end it will give you your list with the useless filters removed.}}</p>

<p>{{s9 This tool has some limitations. It cannot evaluate element hiding filters and will always leave those unchanged. It is also unable to determine whether a regular expression can be removed, although it can detect when a simple filter can be removed due to a regular expression.}}</p>

<p>{{s10 Please open Adblock Plus preferences and mark all the filters you would like to check. Copy them (select Edit — Copy from the menu or press Ctrl+C) and paste them into the text field below. Alternatively you can export your filters and paste the contents of the file into the text field.}}</p>
