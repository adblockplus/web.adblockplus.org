        <p>{{s1 The following roughly lists the changes compared to Adblock 0.5.2.039:}}</p>

        <h2>{{s2 User interface}}</h2>

        <ul>
               <li>{{s3 Clicking "Adblock" in context menu, main menu and status bar opens three different dialogs — FIXED}}</li>
               <li>{{s4 Preferences dialog has buttons OK and Cancel instead of Done and Revert now}}</li>
               <li>{{s5 Filter list in the Preferences dialog is a buggy fork of the default listbox widget — FIXED}}</li>
               <li>{{s6 Menu in the Preferences dialog is the standard menu widget now instead of toolbarbuttons+popups}}</li>
               <li>{{s7 Global key handling routine in the Preferences dialog untangled, making use of preventDefault to ensure correct key handling}}</li>
               <li>{{s8 ENTER key is now interpreted like an OK click in the Preferences dialog (ESC key handling also fixed, see previous point)}}</li>
               <li>{{s9 Flashing the selected/entered URLs works everywhere now}}</li>
               <li>{{s10 Selecting "Keep list sorted" in the Preferences dialog menu applies immediately now instead of displaying a message asking to close and reopen the dialog}}</li>
               <li>{{s11 Adding one menu item to the Tools menu instead of a submenu with three menu items}}</li>
               <li>{{s12 Adding two shortcut keys to the browser window instead of five}}</li>
               <li>{{s13 Not overriding CSS of the current theme any more}}</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>{{s14 Security}}</h2>

        <ul>
               <li>{{s15 No data stored in DOM or otherwise accessible from content scripts}}</li>
               <li>{{s16 Limit interaction with DOM to a minimum}}</li>
               <li>{{s17 Secure DOM access without XPCNativeWrappers}}</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>{{s18 New features}}</h2>

        <ul>
               <li>{{s19 Adblock sidebar (Firefox only) shows blockable URLs in the currently selected tab dynamically}}</li>
               <li>{{s20 Whitelisting, compatible with Adblock Plus. TODO: Better whitelisting + UI}}</li>
               <li>{{s21 About dialog, displaying the installed version number as reported by the extension manager (no need to change it manually with every release)}}</li>
               <li>{{s22 Added three default filters as examples (not referring to any specific sites)}}</li>
               <li>{{s23 Dragging URLs to be blocked to the status bar (no idea what this is good for but maybe that's what the removed drag&drop code was meant for)}}</li>
               <li>{{s24 Enabling/disabling Adblock with a drag gesture on the status bar (another guess what this drag&drop code was meant to do)}}</li>
               <li>{{s25 Localizations are possible now}}</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>{{s26 Removed features}}</h2>

        <ul>
               <li>{{s27 Decide what filters can't possibly apply based on host name — my original implementation was meant as a speedup, it has been severely broken since and turned into a slowdown. The way Adblock works now this speedup can't be used any more.}}</li>
               <li>{{s28 Some weird non functional drag&drop code — can only guess what this was supposed to do, see "new features" above}}</li>
               <li>{{s29 ObjectOverride — was replacing objects with clickable DIVs to allow blocking them, very easy to run into big trouble here. Definitely the wrong way to do this.}}</li>
               <li>{{s30 QuickBlock — I couldn't figure out what this did, not even by looking at the code. Michael McDonald told me now (it removes images temporarily on Ctrl-Shift-DblClick) but I don't think more than 10 people know.}}</li>
               <li>{{s31 Site blocking — very buggy and an absolute non-feature. Blocking a page that was explicitly requested — what does this have to do with ad blocking?}}</li>
               <li>{{s32 Map area disabling — no idea how this is supposed to help block ads. If there is a reason behind this, there is no way for users to figure it out.}}</li>
               <li>{{s33 Removing conflicting shortcut keys from the menu — that's really not a nice thing to do, extensions shouldn't do this.}}</li>
               <li>{{s34 Extension manager window overlay to display Adblock version number in a different format — besides the fact that an extension simply shouldn't do this, the standard version number format is still visible in quite a few places.}}</li>
               <li>{{s35 Installation of a component into the profile in browser versions that don't support this — my big ugly hack to do this was only meant as a temporary measure until proper support for installing components into the profile was added which happened long ago.}}</li>
               <li>{{s36 Very dangerous uninstall code for Mozilla Suite}}</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>{{s37 Cleanup}}</h2>

        <ul>
               <li>{{s38 Lots of bloated and buggy code rewritten.}}</li>
               <li>{{s39 Many error checks added.}}</li>
               <li>{{s40 Made different parts communicate properly (removed communication over preferences amongst other).}}</li>
               <li>{{s41 In-line editing of filters in the filter list rewritten to produce less side effects.}}</li>
               <li>{{s42 Removed nonsensical use of !important CSS flag.}}</li>
               <li>{{s43 60% reduction in XPI size}}</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>{{s44 New known issues}}</h2>

        <ul>
               <li>{{s45 New preferences UI probably concentrates too much information/features on too little space. This needs to be worked on but is still much better then the current Adblock UI.}}</li>
               <li>{{s46 Sidebar only removes entries when new entries are added, need to be more dynamic here.}}</li>
               <li>{{s47 Sidebar could use some efficiency tweaks, to be done soon.}}</li>
        </ul>
