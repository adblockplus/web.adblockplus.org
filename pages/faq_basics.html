      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>{{s2 You can right-click on any image or frame and choose "Adblock" from the context menu. This will open a dialog where you can tweak the new filter before adding. Feel free to replace parts of the banner's address by wildcards (* — the star symbol) to make the filter block other banners with similar addresses as well. For more information you can read <a href="filters">Writing Adblock Plus filters</a>.}}</p>

    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>{{s5 You can click the Adblock Plus icon in the toolbar to bring up the menu. There you have the option to disable/reenable Adblock Plus for the website you are visiting by simply clicking the related slider and then click “refresh”.}}</p>

        <p>{{s6 It will add an exception rule like <code>@@||adblockplus.org^$document</code> to your list of filters. You can find more information on exception rules in <a href="filters#whitelist">Writing Adblock Plus filters</a>}}.</p>

        <p>{{s47 If you want to disable Adblock Plus on all websites, follow these instructions: <a href="https://adblockplus.org/getting_started#disable-reenable">Disabling/Reenabling Adblock Plus on all Websites</a>.}}</p>

    <h2 id="hide-support" itemprop="name">{{s8 Can I support my favorite website by downloading but hiding ads?}}</h2>

    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>{{s9 No. Most advertisers pay per-click, so if you hide ads, you won't actually support the site in question. Even in the off-chance of payouts per-view, it's trivial for advertisers to use JavaScript to check if the ads are visible. Additionally, downloading but hiding ads to trick advertisers into paying would be akin to fraud.}}</p>

        <p>{{s10 In short, if you want to support your favorite websites, you'll have to whitelist them to disable Adblock Plus on those sites.}}</p>

    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>{{s34 Adblock Plus has an option called "Show tabs on Flash and Java". When activated (the default) it will display a button saying "Block" at the upper right (lower right if there isn't enough space) corner of every object. Clicking this button will block the object.}}</p>

    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <p itemprop="text">
        {{s40 You can look for addresses that start differently than the address of the page you are viewing. Banners also typically have keywords like "banner" or "ad" in their address. Click an address to make the corresponding element(s) blink on the page (unfortunately this doesn't work for all types of objects). If you are still unsure, press the middle mouse button on the address to open it in a new tab — there you will definitely see whether it is a banner.}}

    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <p itemprop="text">
        {{s42 No. When Adblock Plus tests an address against your list of filters it determines the best order in which filters should be tested automatically, in fact most of the filters won't be considered at all. The order of filters you can change in the Preferences dialog is for your convenience only, it has no impact on the performance.}}

    <h2 id="regexps" itemprop="name">{{s43 Are regular expressions faster than "normal" filters?}}</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>{{s44 Usually this is not the case. Adblock Plus will transform any "normal" filter into a regular expression, and internally it will work only with regular expressions — there is no difference between the filters <code>banner</code> and <code>/banner/</code>.}}</p>

        <p>{{s45 Regular expressions are often used to "compress" the filters list and replace several filters by one regular expression. The rule of thumb says "fewer filters means faster" but it isn't always correct in this case. Complicated regular expressions require much time to be evaluated, it might be faster to use several simple ones.}}</p>

        <p>{{s46 Regular expression give you more flexibility however, that's where their use is always justified. For example the regular expression <code>/adv(?!ice)/</code> will block <code>adv</code> and <code>advert</code> and <code>advertisement</code> but not <code>advice</code> — something you couldn't have done with simple wildcards.}}</p>
