    {{ abp-worked-hard We know that most users will never pay us, and it’s important to us that it remains that way. We want everyone to be able to use Adblock Plus, regardless of whether they can contribute or not. For those users who can contribute, we want to provide a compelling reason to do so. This year we’ve invested hundreds of hours in improving Adblock Plus’ performance. And we’ve also created Adblock Plus Premium, which creates an improved ad blocking experience by blocking more pop-ups and distractions. }}

    {{ internet-evolves As the internet evolves, traditional pop-up ads aren’t the only distractions you face as you browse the web. There are “sticky” videos that float on your screen and follow you as you browse. And there are many different types of pop-up notifications asking you to sign up for newsletters, share your location, and more. With Adblock Plus Premium, you can enjoy an internet experience with far fewer annoying pop-ups and distractions. You’ll block more ads, pop-ups, and distractions for less than <span class="currency">$</span><span class="amount">2</span> a month. }}
