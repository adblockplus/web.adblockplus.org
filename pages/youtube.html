  {{ youtube-letter__paragraph-1 As an Adblock Plus user, YouTube may occasionally prevent you from playing videos when your ad blocker is turned on. Sometimes a message will ask you to allow YouTube ads after three videos and other times it won’t let you play anything until Adblock Plus is turned off. }}

  {{ youtube-letter__paragraph-2 As we work on keeping our extension up-to-date and effective, YouTube continually works to stop ad blockers on their site. We know this causes you to have an unpredictable and less-than-ideal experience whether you see this message or not. We are doing everything we can to make this experience better for our users. }}
