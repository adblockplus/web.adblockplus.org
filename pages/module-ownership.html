title=Module ownership


<p>{{s1 We're using a module ownership system similar to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/module-ownership.html">what Mozilla has</a>.}}</p>

<h2>{{s2 The module owner role}}</h2>

<p>{{s3 Module owners have functional authority and responsibility over their area. Only the respective super reviewer can overrule their decisions, but this should not be necessary in practice.}}</p>

<h3>{{s4 Responsibilities for module owners}}</h3>

<ul>
  <li>{{s5 Review and approve all changes to the module}}</li>
  <li>{{s6 Grant or revoke commit access}}</li>
  <li>{{s7 Maintain and improve quality}}</li>
  <li>{{s8 Set the priority of new issues and reject them if necessary}}</li>
  <li>{{s9 Ensure all high priority issues get tackled}}</li>
</ul>

<h2>{{s14 Super reviews}}</h2>

<p>{{s15 Each module has a designated super reviewer, who will oversee things at a higher level.}}</p>

<h3>{{s16 Super reviews}}</h3>

<p>{{s17 While the module owner will review all changes, certain changes should also be reviewed by the super reviewer, in particular:}}</p>

<ul>
  <li>{{s18 API changes (both public API as well as API between modules)}}</li>
  <li>{{s19 Major refactoring}}</li>
  <li>{{s20 New subprojects}}</li>
</ul>

<p>{{s21 For these types of changes, the module owner should review first and make sure that all of their comments are addressed, then request a super review.}}</p>
