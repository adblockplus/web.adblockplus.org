### What is personal data? {: #what-is-personal-data }

The purpose of data protection is to protect personal data. Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

This information includes, for example, details such as name and email address, but also nicknames and information in your forum posts.

### What is the purpose of data processing and what is the legal basis? {: #what-is-purpose }

#### Purpose of data collection and processing {: #purpose }

In compliance with Art. 5 (b) GDPR, we collect and process your personal data for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and do not further process your data in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.

We collect and process your personal data solely for the following purposes:

1. We collect and process your personal data, such as website logs and data relating to subscription downloads, extension update checks (such data is collected and processed by Google, see [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)), emergency notifications and Issue Reporter data sent by you, for technical purposes. We mainly collect and process such data to prevent security attacks and are thus able to provide our services to you in a secure and data-efficient manner.
1. We collect and process your personal data relating to subscription downloads, extension updates, emergency downloads, and Issue Reporter data sent to us by you to improve and evaluate our products.
1. We send emergency notifications in order to inform you about urgent issues in connection with our products.
1. We collect and process the data you have provided us with in our blog and forum in order to communicate with you and / or to assist you.
1. We collect data in connection with donations you have made to support us for accounting purposes.

#### Legal basis of data collection and processing {: #legal-basis }

We collect and process your personal data in compliance with the GDPR and the applicable EU laws and German national data protection laws.

#### Collection and processing is based on your consent - Art. 6 (1) a GDPR, Art. 4 (11) GDPR {: #consent-permission }

We will always ask for your consent to collect and process your personal data for the aforementioned specific purposes, unless the collection and processing of your personal data is permitted by statutory laws. Where you have provided us with your consent to the collection and processing of your personal data for the aforementioned specific purposes, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

#### Collection and processing is necessary for taking steps prior to enter into a contract - Art. 6 (1) b GDPR {: #contract-permission }

The collection and processing of your personal data may be necessary for the performance of a contract to which you may be a party. Prior to entering into such a contract, the collection and processing of your personal data may also be necessary in order to take steps at your request. This applies for installation (data gathered by the browser and / or app store) and the use of our products.

Also, all data you provide us with in connection with your application is necessary for the sole purpose of hiring new employees and therefore evaluating and selecting applicants including for example setting up and conducting interviews and tests, evaluating and assessing the results thereto and as is otherwise needed in the recruitment processes including the final recruitment (meaning taking steps prior to enter into an employment contract). If you don’t send us your application data, your application cannot be taken into account.

#### Collection and processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Controller is subject – Art. 6 (1) c GDPR {: #compliance-permission }

Collection and processing of your personal data may be necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject under EU laws or the laws of an EU Member State.

#### Collection and processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests - Art. 6 (1) f GDPR {: #legitimate-interest-permission }

The collection and processing of your personal data may be necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. We collect and process website logs for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, preventing denial of service attacks. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. Preventing such overloads of our systems and any security issues by denial of service attacks is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use the website logs. We use information collected and processed via subscription downloads, extension update checks, emergency notifications and feedback data sent by you, for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, ensuring the security of the extension version used by you. Ensuring the security of our extension is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use such data. Furthermore, we collect and process such data to ensure that our website and extension are constantly improved and adjusted to the changing requirements for an efficient usability and the technical environment. In addition, we collect personal data to remember your privacy settings and/or to keep you logged in. Ensuring the usability of our websites and of our products is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use such data.

To build and improve upon products and features more efficiently, we share personal data, in compliance with GDPR, within the context of a joint controllership with partners. This does not affect how we process personal data as outlined in this privacy policy or how you can exercise your data subject’s rights towards us. You can always contact us with questions or feedback about our privacy policy [here](#data-protection-officer) and can receive the essence of the arrangement between us and our partners via e-mail to <a data-mask='{"href": "bWFpbHRvOnByaXZhY3lAZXllby5jb20="}' title="email address of Data Protection Officer at eyeo GmbH">privacy@eyeo.com</a>.

This data (IP address only aggregated via hashing with a daily changing salt) is used to generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues and forum or blog spam. Detailed logs are retained for a period of 30 days, after which only the aggregated usage statistics that cannot be connected to a single user remain. Everything else is deleted.

##### Emergency notification {: #emergency-notification }

Adblock Plus contains an emergency notification mechanism that allows it to notify users about important issues affecting their Adblock Plus installation. This feature requires all Adblock Plus installations to query an address in the AdblockPlus.org domain regularly to retrieve the list of active notifications. This request makes your IP address visible to the website and also sends some general information like your Adblock Plus version, browser, browser version and the number of previous Adblock Plus downloads (the download number is limited to four, and will be displayed as 4+ after reaching this number). This data allows serving different notifications to different clients and is subject to this [Privacy Policy](https://adblockplus.org/privacy).

##### Further requests {: #further-requests }

Adblock Plus may make further requests to AdblockPlus.org as required. For example, a documentation link is clicked or the full list of filter subscriptions needs to be downloaded. These requests are subject to this [Privacy Policy](https://adblockplus.org/privacy).

##### Uninstallation and donation information

When uninstalling Adblock Plus for desktop and/or donating to us, you will be referred to an uninstallation and/or donation webpage where the following information is automatically collected: Language of your browser, extension name and version, browser type and version, operating system and version, number of notification downloads, information whether the local storage of the extension configuration is corrupted, version parameter of filter lists, and whether any filter subscriptions have been enabled or disabled at the time of uninstallation. On a voluntary basis, you can provide us with your reason why you have uninstalled Adblock Plus. We need this information to improve our products.

For donations, we work with payment providers (Stripe, Inc. and PayPalPaypal S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A.). These providers are responsible for processing the data you enter in regards to the  donations you send to us. Processing includes all data you enter into the respective form, as but not limited to, the type of card, cardholder name, credit card details (except full card number), address, country, zip/postal code, and email address. In addition, Stripe collects identifying information about the devices that connect to its services and uses this information for fraud detection. For further information as to how these providers handle the processing of personal data, please refer to Stripe’s [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) and PayPal’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full). We store the reports the payment service providers present us with for accounting purposes.

##### Data retention {: #data-retention }

Data related to subscription downloads, extension update checks, emergency notifications, Issue Reporter data (as well as the full reports and their associated data), and data in connection with uninstallations and donations are automatically removed after 30 days. Only a subset of the data will be kept longer. This includes only the country code of users filing an issue (extracted from the IP address) for analytic purposes, which is stored separately from the full reports and cannot be connected to an individual after deletion of the full reports. Donation report data is stored for a period of 10 years in accordance with the German tax law requirements.

Adblock Plus stores some data in [the Firefox profile](http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Profiles) on your computer. Adblock Plus never transmits this data to any servers, but other extensions and services, such as [Firefox Sync](https://mozilla.com/privacy-policy/), may do so. Most of the data (your preferences, filter subscriptions and custom filters) is unobjectionable privacy-wise. However, filter hit statistics and recent issue reports could be used to reconstruct your browsing history. Adblock Plus treats this information identically to how history data is treated by the browser; this data isn't stored if you are using [private browsing mode](http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Private+Browsing) and is removed if you choose to clear your browsing history.

#### Collection and processing on our websites {: #collection-processing-of-websites }

When using our websites, as AdblockPlus.org and AdblockBrowser.org (Websites), we automatically collect the following data in order to provide you with our services, and for security reasons:

##### Automatically collected information {: #auto-collected-info }

###### Website logs {: #website-logs }

All requests to our Websites are recorded in the website logs. Data stored includes your IP address (solely for the purpose of IT security and only accessible by eyeo's IT Security team), information about the request itself including date and time, domain and file path, request body and query, information about the response include response code and bytes, and session ID information needed to test and operate the website. This data (IP address only aggregated via hashing with a daily changing salt) is used to generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues and forum or blog spam. Detailed logs are retained for a period of 30 days, after which only the aggregated usage statistics that cannot be connected to a single user remain. Everything else is deleted.

###### Data retention {: #retention-website-requests }

The request to our Websites, including your IP address, is stored when you create a forum post, submit a contact form, or add a blog comment. This allows administrators to effectively address spam content and security breaches. All stored requests are deleted after 30 days.

###### Necessary cookies {: #cookies }

We use cookies to recognize signed-in users or to store your privacy preferences. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer with the help of your internet browser. The cookies are necessary to provide you with our services, are not evaluated in any other manner, and are never used to track Website visitors. If you do not want to enable cookies, you can opt against using them by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Please note that the efficiency and range of eyeo's services may be restricted as a result.

###### For non-EU/EEA users only: Google Analytics {: #google-analytics }

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service from Google Inc. ("Google"), on our Websites. Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies" (text files stored on your computer that enable us to analyze your use of our Websites). Information generated by the cookies (including your abbreviated IP address) is transmitted to and stored at a Google server in the United States. Google uses this information to assess your use of our Websites, to compile activity reports, and to provide more services connected with the use of our Websites. It is possible that Google may transmit this information to third parties if required by law, or if third parties process this information on behalf of Google.

**You can deactivate Google Analytics if you do not want to help us improve our products.** But please note that in this case, a cookie will be set that stores your deactivation choice. This cookie is considered a “necessary cookie” and can’t be deactivated.

<? include cookie/settings-link ?>

###### For non-EU/EEA users only: Google Tag Manager {: #google-tag-manager }

Our Website uses Google Tag Manager for the implementation of [Google Analytics](#google-analytics). Google Tag Manager, provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google”), is a solution that allows marketed website tags to be managed using an interface. The Tag Manager tool itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-less domain and does not register personal data. The tool causes other tags to be activated. These tags then may register data under certain deactivated domains or on a cookie level. This setting will remain in place for all tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager.

###### For non-EU/EEA users only: Google Optimize {: #google-optimize }

Our Website uses the web analysis and optimization service Google Optimize provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google”). We use the Google Optimize service to increase the attractiveness, content and functionality of our Website by playing new features and content to a percentage of our users and statistically evaluating the usage change (A/B testing). Google Optimize is a sub-service of [Google Analytics](#google-analytics).

Google Optimize uses cookies, which enable us to optimize and analyze your use of our Website. The information generated by these cookies about your use of our Website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. We use Google Optimize with activated IP anonymization so that your IP address is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union, or within the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our Website, compiling reports on optimization tests and related website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.

**You can deactivate Google Optimize if you do not want to help us improve our products.** But please note that in this case, a cookie will be set that stores your deactivation choice. This cookie is considered a “necessary cookie” and can’t be deactivated.

We have embedded the Facebook Messenger functionality, owned by Facebook, Inc., into the adblock.ai website to enable you to submit screenshots to our bot (“Adblock AI”) via Messenger, without having to access the Facebook website. Please note that Messenger is hosted by Facebook. We have disabled the function that would otherwise send personal data to Facebook when you access our website; however, when you click on the button to help train Adblock AI with your screenshots (“START NOW”) you will activate Messenger. Only then will some personal data, including IP address, be transferred to Facebook. For more information, please review Facebook's [Privacy Policy](https://facebook.com/privacy/explanation). **If you do not want to transfer data to Facebook, please do not click on the button to send information to Adblock AI through Facebook Messenger.**

###### Email collection {: #email-collection }

**Campaigns**

Some of eyeo's Websites host product campaigns that rely on email collection. For example, you can request a link by email to install Adblock Browser on your mobile device. We do not use third parties to manage these campaigns. Instead, data that you submit is handled in-house (i.e. turned into an email or used to send the email). We will never share or sell your email address, or any other information collected, to any third parties.

In general, we do not store your email address unless it’s specifically required to execute the related campaign (i.e. email signups for a newsletter or signing up to get notified about a product launch). In cases where we do store your email address, we only store it for the length of time that is needed to execute the campaign (i.e. once you’ve been notified of the launch).

In terms of Facebook, both Facebook and eyeo are jointly responsible for the processing of your personal data (“joint controller”, GDPR Art. 26), even if it is stored exclusively by the respective social network. Therefore, we still inform you about the data processing processes in connection with our presence on the respective social network as follows.

If you follow our respective online presence on one or more of the social networks used by us, please note that your data may be processed outside the European Union / the European Economic Area. However, all the networks we use have agreed to comply with EU data protection standards.

The social networks we use also process your data regularly for market research and advertising purposes. Based on your usage behavior and interests, the networks may create usage profiles which are used, for example, to place advertisements corresponding to your potential interests within and outside of the networks. For these purposes, cookies, which store your usage behavior and interests, as well as possibly also the devices you use, are regularly stored on your computer.

For a detailed overview of the respective processing operations and opt-out options, please visit the website of each social network, listed below. For the assertion of your rights and requests for information, we also refer you to the respective social networks, where you can exercise your rights most effectively. This is because the social networks have access to your data and can therefore directly take appropriate measures and provide you with the respective information:

#### Links / buttons to social media

The links / buttons to social networks and platforms (Facebook and Twitter) used within Adblock Plus for the purpose to enable you to share the amount of elements you have blocked with Adblock Plus generally only establish contact between social networks or platforms and you when you click on the links / buttons. This function corresponds to the way a regular online link works. If you click on a corresponding link / button, this opens a new page via the servers of the respective social network or platform. Through this, the operator of the social network is informed that our website has been accessed via your IP address. At the same time, the social network can place cookies on your terminal device or read cookies unless you have prohibited the use of cookies in your browser. For further information on any processing of your personal data by the operators of the social networks or platforms, please refer to the privacy policies of Facebook ([https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation)) and Twitter ([https://twitter.com/privacy](https://twitter.com/privacy)).
