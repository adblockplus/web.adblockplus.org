## {{what-are-aa[heading] What are Acceptable Ads?}} {: #what-are-those }

{{ what-are-aa-1 Acceptable Ads are ads that aren’t intrusive or annoying. They are respectful, don’t interfere with content, and are clearly labeled with the word “advertisement” or its equivalent. In order for an ad to be an “Acceptable Ad”, it must adhere to [standards](#criteria) that have been set forth by the [Acceptable Ads Committee](https://acceptableads.com/en/committee/). }}

{{ what-are-aa-2 Ads that abide by Acceptable Ads standards are placed on a whitelist. The ads on the whitelist are then shown to ad-blocking users who allow Acceptable Ads. }}

{{ what-are-aa-3 Most websites use advertising to make money, meaning that you can see these websites for free. However, many websites use too many annoying or intrusive ads to get your attention. Adblock Plus lets you choose to block ads, but we don’t believe websites should be punished. }}

### {{ what-are-aa-wo[heading] What are Acceptable Ads without third-party tracking? }} {: #without-third-party-tracking }

{{ what-are-aa-wo-1 Acceptable Ads without third-party tracking are ads that comply with the Acceptable Ads criteria and that do not allow third-party entities to track any of your browsing behavior. These are ads that comply with [Do Not Track](https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy){: title="Link to the Do Not Track Policy by EFF" }, and / or ads which are served by the domain which is wholly owned by the same company. }}

## {{ why-is-aa-enabled[heading] Why is the Acceptable Ads feature enabled by default? }} {: #enabled-by-default }

{{ why-is-aa-enabled-1 We believe that Acceptable Ads are the sustainable middle ground between a user’s choice to use an ad blocker and the continued need to support free online content with advertisements. If the majority of Adblock Plus users have the Acceptable Ads feature enabled, advertisers will have a bigger incentive to produce better, less intrusive ad formats. }}
