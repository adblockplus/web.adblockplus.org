<p>
    {{ how-does-abp-work-2 Filter lists are sets of rules that tell your browser which elements to block. You can block as little or as much as you want. Choose from pre-made, externally maintained filter lists, or <a href="https://help.eyeo.com/en/adblockplus/how-to-write-filters?3910d1c0" title="How to write filters">create your own (English only)</a>.

<p>
    {{ how-does-abp-work-3 <strong>Many ads have tracking built in and some may even contain malware. Because of this, Adblock Plus provides certain levels of tracking and malware protection by default. If you want, you can add additional tracking and malware filter lists to increase your protection.</strong> }}

<h2 id="acceptableads">{{s11 What are Acceptable Ads?}}</h2>

<p>
    {{s12 We don't think all ads are bad and are fully aware that ads finance many websites. So, in <fix>2009</fix> we decided to find some common ground. Our solution involved asking <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> users, and our community at large, to help identify criteria that makes for better ads. From these discussions, we established <a href="acceptable-ads#criteria">strict criteria</a> to identify nonintrusive ads. In <fix>2011</fix>, we began implementing the Acceptable Ads initiative. Participants that wish to comply with the Acceptable Ads initiative can <a href="acceptable-ads#application">apply</a> to be added to the Acceptable Ads list. Participating in the Acceptable Ads initiative is usually free of charge for participants. Only larger entities, which gain more than <fix>10</fix> million additional ad impressions through their participation, are required to pay a monthly fee (for more information, please read about <a href="#monetization">how we are financed</a>). <fix>Adblock Plus</fix> users have the option to display ads that are on the Acceptable Ads list or to disable the Acceptable Ads feature and browse completely <a href="acceptable-ads#optout">ad-free</a>. To view the list of acceptable ads, visit the <a href="https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=12">Acceptable Ads Proposals forum</a>.}}

<h2 id="monetization">{{financed-how[Section header] How we are financed}}</h2>

<p>
    {{acceptable-ads-monetization[Paragraph in "How we are financed" section] We receive some donations from our users, but our main source of revenue comes as part of the Acceptable Ads initiative. As detailed below, larger entities pay a licensing fee for the whitelisting services requested and provided to them (around <fix>90</fix> percent of the licences are granted for free, to smaller entities). It should be noted that all ads must first abide by the <a href="/acceptable-ads#criteria">Acceptable Ads criteria</a>, regardless of whether the entity serving them would be required to pay or not. If the criteria are not met, whitelisting is impossible.}}
</p>

<p>
    {{fee-details[Text in "How we are financed" section] Here are some details regarding the fees:}}
</p>

<ul>
    <li>{{large-entities-pay[Bullet point in "How we are financed" section] Only large entities have to pay. We qualify an entity as large when it gains more than 10 million additional ad impressions per month due to participation in the Acceptable Ads initiative.}}</li>
    <li>{{licensing-fee[Bullet point in "How we are financed" section] For these entities, our licensing fee normally represents 30 percent of the additional revenue created by whitelisting its acceptable ads. }}</li>
</ul>

<p>
    {{managing-acceptable-ads[Paragraph in "How we are financed" section] Managing the Acceptable Ads initiative requires significant effort on our side including, but not limited to, ongoing review and monitoring of the individual whitelisted ads, counseling participants and technical support. These services cannot be completely taken over by volunteers nor be sponsored through donations, as may be the case with commonly used filter lists.}}
</p>

<p>
    {{large-entities-compensate[Paragraph in "How we are financed" section] Therefore, a few very large entities who take part in the Acceptable Ads initiative compensate Eyeo for its services. Eyeo's services are provided free of charge to all other participants (roughly 90%).}}
</p>

<p>
    {{must-meet-strict-criteria[Paragraph in "How we are financed" section] <strong>Important:</strong> Every entity on the whitelist - paying participant or non-paying participant - MUST maintain the same strict criteria that our users accepted as part of the Acceptable Ads initiative. We will never accept any ad that doesn't meet these <a href="/acceptable-ads#criteria">criteria</a>. There is no way to buy a spot on the Acceptable Ads exception list. All whitelisted ads and participating entities are publicly listed on our <a href="/forum/viewforum.php?f=12">forum</a>. Feel free to discuss and share your opinions.}}
