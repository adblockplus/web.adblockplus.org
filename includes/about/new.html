</p>

<p>
    {{ how-is-abp-financed-2 Implementing the Acceptable Ads criteria is part of eyeo’s (the company behind Adblock Plus) attempt to pursue a different vision of online advertising. It requires significant effort on eyeo’s side including, but not limited to, ongoing review and monitoring of the individual whitelisted ads, advising participants, and providing technical support. These services cannot be done as a hobby, or completely taken over by volunteers. }}
</p>

<p>
    {{ how-is-abp-financed-3 Therefore we only charge large entities a license fee so that we can offer the same whitelisting services to everyone and maintain our resources to develop the best software for our users. }}

<p>
    {{ how-is-abp-financed-5 We qualify an entity as large when it gains more than 10 million additional ad impressions per month due to participation in the Acceptable Ads initiative.

    {{ about-aa-2 Back in 2011, after discussions with Adblock Plus users and our community at large, we began implementing the Acceptable Ads initiative.

Thanks to the initiative, Adblock Plus users have the option to display certified ads that are part of the Acceptable Ads initiative or to disable the feature and browse free of annoying ads. }}
