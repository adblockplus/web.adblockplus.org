Adblock Plus cannot support old application versions for an indefinite amount of time, already because after a while too few people use that application version and bugs no longer get noticed. Best solution is updating to a new application version and installing Adblock Plus then. If for some reason that is not possible, as a temporary solution you can also have a look at <a>older Adblock Plus versions</a>, one of them might be compatible."
