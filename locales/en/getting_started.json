    "message": "How does Adblock Plus work?"
  },
  "s8": {
    "message": "In order to block ads, Adblock Plus requires the so-called filters to \"tell\" it which requests to block. Out of the box, Adblock Plus comes without any filters, but, it will offer you to add a filter subscription on first start. With these filters enabled, it can block specific requests from websites, usually the requests to serve an ad. Blocked ads often leave blank spaces or \"Advertising Tags\" on webpages. Adblock Plus is still able to remove these with a functionality called \"element-hiding\": based on certain specific characteristics, Adblock Plus is able to hide certain elements from the webpage."
