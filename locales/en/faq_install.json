Locate the file adblockplus.js (this is <code>extensions/{d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}/defaults/preferences/adblockplus.js</code> in Firefox and <code>defaults/pref/adblockplus.js</code> in SeaMonkey) and edit it. You probably don't want that users are bothered with the Adblock Plus icon so you can change <a>extensions.adblockplus.showintoolbar</a> and <a>extensions.adblockplus.showinstatusbar</a> to <code>false</code>. If you don't want that users get the suggestion to install a subscription when they start Firefox for the first time you also change <a>{1}</a> to \"2.0\"."

For SeaMonkey this is (unfortunately) the only option, in Firefox you create a subdirectory <code>{d10d0bf8-f5b5-c8b4-a8b2-2b9879e08c5d}</code> in its <code>extensions</code> directory and unpack the contents of adblockplus.xpi there (it is a regular ZIP file)."

    "message": "Finally you might want to make everybody use the same filter list. To do so you change the default settings for <a>extensions.adblockplus.patternsfile</a>. By default this file is stored in user's profile directory (relative path), use an absolute path to set a fixed location for everybody. Make sure that everybody can read the file but you are the only one having write access to it — now you can start your browser and add some filters/subscriptions that everybody will use. The changes users make to the filter list won't persist since they don't have write access to the file."
